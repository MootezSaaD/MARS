# Modifications
- Replaced the default fonts with [Monaco](https://github.com/todylu/monaco.ttf) Font.
- Changed default Java SWING colors with a dark theme.

# Limitations
- Static theme : There is no option to switch between themes.
- The font is loaded locally, so the user needs to change the path inside the source-code, it could be replaced with a link but it would slow the performance of the IDE.
